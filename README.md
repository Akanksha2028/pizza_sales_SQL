# **Pizza Sales Analysis Project in MySQL**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes pizza sales data using **MySQL** to gain insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue patterns. By leveraging SQL queries, the analysis helps identify best-selling pizza types, peak sales periods, and revenue contributions across different pizza categories.

## **Objectives**
- Retrieve key sales metrics such as **total orders and total revenue**.
- Identify **top-selling pizzas**, common pizza sizes, and customer preferences.
- Analyze **sales distribution by hour, date, and category**.
- Compute revenue trends and identify opportunities for business growth.

## **Data Structure**
The analysis is based on three key tables:

1. **orders** â€“ Stores information about each order (order date, order time).
2. **orders_details** â€“ Contains details about each order, including the pizza type and quantity.
3. **pizzas & pizza_types** â€“ Stores pizza-specific information like price, size, and category.
